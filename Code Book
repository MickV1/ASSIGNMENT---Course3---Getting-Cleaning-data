Variables contain X, Y or Z. There are 554 of them.
They represent 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


Variables contain "Gyroscope" or "Accelerometer".
The smartphone embeds two sensor signals for recording the results of activities,
accelerometer and gyroscope respectively.

Variables contain Time_Acc_XYZ and Time_Gyro_XYZ.
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were 
filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

Variables contain Time_BodyAcc_XYZ and Time_GravityAcc_XYZ.
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Time_BodyAccJerk_XYZ and Time_BodyGyroJerk_XYZ.
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals.

Time_BodyAccMag, Time_GravityAccMag, Time_BodyAccJerkMag, Time_BodyGyroMag 
and Time_BodyGyroJerkMag.
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
norm.

Frequency_BodyAcc-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerk-XYZ, Frequency_BodyGyro-XYZ, 
Frequency_BodyAccJerkMag, Frequency_BodyGyroMag and 
Frequency_BodyGyroJerkMag.
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing these 
variables.

Variables contain mean: Mean value.

Variables contain std: Standard deviation.

There were also 7 angles between vectors:

555 angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)
556 angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
557 angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
558 angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
559 angle(X,gravityMean)
560 angle(Y,gravityMean)
561 angle(Z,gravityMean)

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

Notes:

Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
