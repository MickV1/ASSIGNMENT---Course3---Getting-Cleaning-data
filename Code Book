Variables contain X, Y or Z. There are 554 of them.
They represent 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.


Variables contain "Gyroscope" or "Accelerometer".
The smartphone embeds two sensor signals for recording the results of activities,
accelerometer and gyroscope respectively.

Variables contain Time_Acc_XYZ and Time_Gyro_XYZ.
These time domain signals were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were 
filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner
frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

Variables contain Time_BodyAcc_XYZ and Time_GravityAcc_XYZ.
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using 
another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Time_BodyAccJerk_XYZ and Time_BodyGyroJerk_XYZ.
The body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk 
signals.

Time_BodyAccMag, Time_GravityAccMag, Time_BodyAccJerkMag, Time_BodyGyroMag 
and Time_BodyGyroJerkMag.
The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean 
norm.

Frequency_BodyAcc-XYZ, Frequency_BodyAccJerk-XYZ, Frequency_BodyGyro-XYZ, 
Frequency_BodyAccJerkMag, Frequency_BodyGyroMag and 
Frequency_BodyGyroJerkMag.
A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing these 
variables.

Variables contain mean: Mean value.

Variables contain std: Standard deviation.

There were also 7 angles between vectors:

555 angle(tBodyAccMean,gravity)
556 angle(tBodyAccJerkMean),gravityMean)
557 angle(tBodyGyroMean,gravityMean)
558 angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
559 angle(X,gravityMean)
560 angle(Y,gravityMean)
561 angle(Z,gravityMean)
